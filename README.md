# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
This project demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to develop a CNN model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.
